What is C Programming
	C is the general purpose programming language that has wide range of applications.
	Initially developed to rewrite the UNIX Operating System.
	Google Chrome, Firefox, MySQL, etc are developed using C.
	Old language created during 1970s.
	C is not outdated. It is very fast and efficient.
	To develop compiler or OS, C is the good option.
	C Programming allows to access the hardware components at deeper level.
	According to Glassdoor (popular job portal site) there are about 18000 job openings in US.
	Many universities teaching C Programming as the first language.
	Learning C helps to understand how the software and hardware interact with each other and allows to work directly with the computer memory.
	
	While(*s++ = *p++);
	
	"If you cant understand why this code copies a string, you are programming based on Superstition" - Joel Spolsky.
	
	Pre Requisites for C Programming
		C Compiler
		Text Editor
	
	First program.
	
	#include<stdio.h>
	int main(){
		printf("Hello World!");
		return 0;
	}
	
	Run this program.
	
	Every C program starts from the main function.
	We will write our code inside the curly braces.
	
	Variables in C Programming
		Variable is a name given to a memory location inside our computer where we can store data.
	
		int age;
		age = 30;
		
		Every variable must have a type.
		Every statement must end up with semicolon.
		
		declaration and initialization.
		int age=30;
		
	printf("C Programming"); - Printing a string literal.
	printf("%d",age); - Print the value of the variable. "%d" is format specifier. "%d" is replaced by the value of variable age.
	
	printf("Age :%d", age);
	
	Change value of variables
		int main(){
			int age=25;
			printf("Age: %d",age);
			age = 31;
			printf("\nNew age: %d",age);
			retrn 0;
		}
		Here the value of the variable is changed from 25 to 31. \n is the newline character.
		
	Assign variable to another variable.
		int main(){
			int firstNumber = 31;
			printf("First Number = %d", firstNumber);
			int secondNumber = firstNumber;
			printf("\nSecond Number = %d", secondNumber);
		}
	
	Declaring Multiple Variables at once
		
		int firstNumber,secondNumber = 25;
		
		This statement creates two integer variables and 25 is stored in secondNumber variable. firstNumber contains some garbage value.
		
	Variable naming conventions.
		variables names should not contain spaces.
		C Programming keywords should not be used as variable names. Ex: if, else, for, switch,int, etc.
		Variable names should be descriptive.
		For two world variable namess follow the camel case word.

	Data Types in C Programming
	
		Data type specifies the type of data stored in the variable.
		Data Type determines two things -> type of data and size of the variable.
		
		Different Data types:
			int		4 bytes		%d for printing
			double	8 bytes		%lf for printing
			float	4 bytes 	%f for printing
			char 	1 bytes		%c for printing
			bool	1 bit
			
			int main(){
				double number1 = 12.45;
				float number2 = 10.9f;
				
				printf("%lf",number1);
				printf(\n%.2lf",number1);
				
				printf("\n%f",number);
				printf("\n%.1f",number);
				return 0;
			}
			Exponential Numbers can also be stored in double and float.
			
			double number = 5.5e6;
				Here 5.5e6 is 5.5 multiply by 10 to the power of 6.
			
			int main(){
				double number = 5.5e6;
				printf("%lf",number);
				return 0;
			}
			
		char data type.
			int main(){
				char character = 'z';
				printf("%c",character);
				return 0;
			}
		Internally Character data is stored as integer.
			printf("%d",character);
		
		Use single quotation to specify the character data.
		use %c format specifier to print.
		character stored as integers internally. ASCII value.
		
	sizeof() Operator
		used to find the size of data types.
		
		int main(){
			int age;
			double number;
			printf("int size = %zu", sizeof(age));
			printf("\ndouble size = %zu", sizeof(number));
			return 0;
		}
	
	Take Input and Print Output in C Programming
		scanf function is used to get input from the user at runtime and store the value in the address of the variable.
		scanf function has 2 parts. Format Specifier and Variable with Ampersand.
			Ampersand specifies the memory address of the variable.
			
		int main(){
			int age;
			printf("Enter input value:");
			scanf("%d",&age);
			printf("\nAge = %d",age);
			return 0;
		}
	
		int main(){
			double number;
			char alphabet;
			printf("Enter double input:");
			scanf("%lf",&number);
			printf("Enter charater input:");
			scanf("%c",&alphabet);
			
			printf("Number: %lf",number);
			printf("\nCharacter: %c",alphabet);
			return 0;
		}
	Take Multiple Inputs using single scanf function
		int main(){
			double number;
			char alphabet;
			printf("Enter input values:");
			scanf("%lf %c",&number, &alphabet);
			
			printf("Number: %lf",number);
			printf("\nCharacter: %c",alphabet);
			return 0;
		}
		
		Try reading Integer and Float input data from the user.
		
		#include<studio.h>
		int main(){
			bool value1 = true;
			bool value2 = false;
			printf("%d  %d",value1,value1);
			return 0;
		}
		
	Comments in C Programming
		Comments makes our code easier to understand.
		Compiler will ignore the comments in the C Program.
		Single Line Comments
		Multi Line Comments 
		Select the lines. Press Ctrl + Shift + Forward Slash. Keyboard shortcut for multiline comment.
		Ctrl + Forward slash is the keyboard shortcut for sintle line comment.
		In the real time project development by team, comments are very important to explain the changes.
		
	Operators in C
		Symbols used to perform operations on values and variables.
		Already we have used one operator in our previous programs. = (Assignment operator)
		
		Arithmetic Operators
		+	Addition
		-	Subtraction
		*	Multiplication
		/	Division
		%	Remainder (Modulus)
		++	Increment
		--	Decrement
		
		int x=12;
		int result = x + 8;
		printf("%d",result);
		printf("%d",x+10);
		
		int x=12;
		int y=x++;
		printf("%d",--x);
		
		int x=4/2+6*5-1;
		printf("%d",x);
		
		Operators with higher precedence executed first and operators with lower precedence executed last.
		BODMAS
		
	Implicit Type Conversion:
		char a = '5';
		int b=9;
		int result = a+b;
		printf("%d" result);
		
		Here char value is converted to its ascii value (53) and added with integer value.
		
		double a=5.67;
		int b=9;
		double result = a+b;
		printf("%lf",result);
		
		Here int value is converted to double value (by including .00) and added with double value.
		
		Type conversion occur according to the data type hierarchy.
		Data type lower in hierarchy will be converted to higher.
		
		Hierarchy is 
			long double
			double
			float
			long
			int
			short
			char 
		
		int a=5.67;
		Here double value is converted to int with data loss.
		
	Explicit Type Conversion.
		double a = 5.67;
		int b=9;
		double result = (int)a + b;
		printf("%lf",result);
		
		Here double value a will be converted into int.

	! 	(Logical NOT)
	
	Bitwise Operators:

	| 	(Bitwise OR)
	^ 	(Bitwise XOR)
	~ 	(Bitwise NOT/One's complement)
	<< 	(Left Shift)
